<h1>The Censored Vaccine</h1>
<h3>Why so few adolescents are getting the HPV vaccine and what can be done about it</h3> 
<h5>By Claire Maldarelli</h5>


<p>When Dr. Kevin Ault admits that the South, which is home to the three populations with the highest cervical cancer rates in the country –rural communities, Hispanic, and African American women – also has one of the lowest HPV vaccination rates, his naturally optimistic and cheerful mood drops. “Here in Georgia we have all three groups. They are certainly the hardest to vaccinate and that is so distressing,” he said. <p>


<p>The HPV vaccine has been available for seven years. But, despite numerous studies showing it’s highly effective, the percent of American adolescents who get the vaccine is alarmingly low. </p>

<p>Ault is an obstetrician and gynecologist at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Along with other doctors throughout the country, he’s long been aware that cervical cancer rates vary dramatically between race and location. But recent data, showing the national rates for the HPV vaccine haven’t just stayed the same but have decreased, is raising the cause for concern. </p>

<p>“The bottom line is that we have a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and if it isn’t being used effectively, something needs to be done,” says Dr. Rebecca Perkins, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine in Boston, Massachusetts. </p>

<p> In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that only about half of all 11-12 year old girls reported getting the first shot of the three-shot series and just 33 percent reported completing the vaccine series. The CDC as well as doctors and researchers agree that the only way to ensure protection against cervical cancer is get all three shots. In other words, just one vaccine won't cut it.  </p>

These low vaccination rates are prompting some advocates to call for aggressive tactics, including stepping up educational efforts, providing free shots, and permitting teens to get vaccinated without parental consent. <p>


Even with this effort, between 2011 and 2012, the number of girls getting the vaccine decreased by 0.8 percent. But outside the United States, where interventional tactics are widely accepted, HPV vaccination rates have soared. In Australia, one of the first countries to enact a nationally financed vaccination program, more than 85 percent of young girls are vaccinated each year. <p>

Why the United States’ vaccination rates are remarkably lower than other countries’ rates may have more to do with American’s attitude toward the vaccine rather than their lack of effort to vaccinate. Perkins says that while the vaccine should be presented as normal and routine, health care providers present it as an optional treatment. “Many pediatricians tell parents, ‘Well your child definitely needs these vaccines and then there is this other one that you can think about getting,’” Perkins says, “And this creates doubt where otherwise there would be no doubt present.” For this reason, the HPV vaccine consistently lags behind other vaccinations for its age group. <p> 

<p> MMR, a vaccine that protects against three viral infections -- measles, mumps and rubella -- is given once at 12-15 months and again at 4-6 years. The national average for MMR vaccination is 91.4 percent and no state dips below 80 percent. TDAP (for protection against Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertussis), MenACWY (for meningitis protection) and the HPV Vaccine (Gardasil and Cervarix) are the three vaccines recommended for girls aged 11-12 years old. While they are meant to be given at the same appointment, their vaccine rates vary drastically. Although TDap and MenACWY's national averages are both below the national average for MMR, they are still way above the national average for HPV. <p>

Across the country, parental resistance is still a universal barrier. A recent poll by the University of Michigan that asked adults whether they would allow adolescents ages 12-17 to receive the HPV vaccine without parental consent found that less than half, 45 percent of respondents, would support state laws allowing this. Sarah Clark, Associate Director of Research at Michigan’s Child Health Evaluation and Research Unit, says the poll shows that parents’ concerns about the HPV vaccine aren’t being addressed. “It’s not crazy to have questions about it. But that means a discussion needs to happen between doctors and parents that just isn’t happening,” Clark says. <p>

This is especially important when other factors, such as cost and socioeconomic status, may not negatively affect HPV vaccination rates. The CDC’s Stokley says that although the vaccine is expensive, about $130 per dose, cost has not been identified as a barrier to receiving the vaccine. “Most private insurance companies cover the cost and children who are uninsured are eligible to receive the vaccine for free through the Vaccines for Children program,” Stokley says. And although vaccination rates vary widely among regions, Perkins says that from what she has seen in her practice and through multiple studies, race and socioeconomic status do not play a role. “If you go family by family, I don’t see any differences,” Perkins says. In fact, she finds that Hispanic families, in particular, are often more perceptive to the vaccine than any other race, “In many Hispanic countries, vaccination is still vital to survival so they see it like any other vaccine.” <p>

What will increase acceptance of the HPV vaccine? Experts agree that more focused educational campaigns, especially in the most deprived regions, must be implemented. But Clark says this might not be enough, emphasizing that more importance should be placed on the young girls getting vaccinated. “The key is helping adolescents become more invested in the decision by helping them understand the reasons why this vaccine is important in a way that means something to them,” Clark says. Perkins stresses that time should not be wasted in addressing these concerns. “There are certainly cultural differences and varying degrees of willingness,” Perkins says, “But just because we know what causes it doesn’t mean we should ignore it.” <p>
