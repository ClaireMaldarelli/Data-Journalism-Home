<h1>Final Pitch</h1>

<p>Although the FDA approved the HPV vaccine over 10 years ago, the number of young women who actually receive the vaccine is extremely low. The CDC has recently released data on this as well as many other reports about the low uptake of this potentially life-saving vaccine. Many studies have found that vaccination rate varies widely among states and regions in the United State – just 17 percent of all young women and a mere six percent of those in southern states received all three shots.</p>  
<p>This subject has been reported on but only as a news feature with no data visualization section. This could be published soon as the data is very recent or could wait until the beginning of the school year when many teenagers are receiving vaccinations.</p>
<p>I would like to create an interactive color coordinated graph of the United States.</p>
<h3>Ideally, my graph would answer the following questions:</h3>

<p>1.	What percent of young women in each state receive the HPV vaccine?</p>
<p>2.	How does this compare to other vaccines recommended for the same age group?</p>
<p>3.	Does vaccination rate have any correlation between those who are insured versus those who are uninsured?</p>
<p>4.	What are each state’s policies on the HPV vaccine and how does that correlate with vaccination rate? (Some states give the vaccine out for free)</p>
<p>5.	What age group has the highest vaccination rate, the lowest?</p>

<h3>Data I will use:</h3>
<p>1.	http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6229a4.htm</p>
<p>2.	http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/stats-surv/nisteen/data/tables_2012.htm#age</p>
<p>3.	http://kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-hpv-vaccine-access-and-use-in/</p>
<p>I would like to talk to members of the CDC and other researchers who have reported on the subject.</p>
<h3>Potential sources include:</h3>
<p>1.	Rebecca Perkins, BU School of Medicine</p>
<p>2.	Shannon Stokley, CDC</p>
<p>3.	Mahbubur Rahman, UT Galveston</p> 
<p>4.	Sarah Clarke, Associate Director of Research at Michigan’s Child Health Evaluation and Research Unit</p>
<h3>I could pitch this to:</h3>
<p>1.	Scientific American</p>
<p>2.	Popular Science</p>
<p>3.	NPR ScienceFriday.com.</p> 
<p>To complete this assignment, I would have to learn how to incorporate multiple pieces of data into each state on the graph so that I would be able to answer all the questions listed above.</p>
