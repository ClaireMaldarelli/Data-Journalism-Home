Claire Maldarelli – Data Journalism Pitches 

1. Along with cats, dogs are the most common pets in America. But each breed comes with its own temperament and predisposition to diseases. One breed of dog is not right for everyone. When choosing a dog, potential owners must do their own research on which dog they would like to purchase. There is no interactive website right now that takes in your information and tells you what breed of dog would be most ideal for you.
My project would be an interactive map of all the dog breeds with pictures of each of them. If you scroll over a picture of say a Golden Retriever, it would show relevant information that a potential dog owner would need to know about owning and caring for a Golden Retriever. It would also possibly include a list of questions (around 10) that viewers would answer about their lifestyle and in return they would get the top three types of dogs that would be best for them. 
 This topic is not often written about in a journalistic sense, but there is a lot of information about breed types and their disposition on websites such as the AKC and other breed specific organizations. 
I would like to talk to some animal science and breeding experts. I recently wrote an article about dog breeding practices so I have some good contacts for that. 
I would definitely need to learn how to get data from the AKC website since I don’t want to download information on every breed of dogs. I would also need to understand how to create a map using images of dogs and if this is not possible, come up with another creative idea for the map. 
I could pitch this to a number of quirky science magazines such as Quartz or Popular Science. 

2. How many women are receiving the HPV per state? 
Although the HPV vaccine has been out for over 10 years, the number of young women who actually receive the vaccine is extremely low. The CDC has recently released data on this as well as many other reports about the low uptake of this life-saving vaccine. Many studies have found that the south has the lowest uptake while the northeast has the highest uptake.
This subject has been reported on but only as a news feature with no data visualization section. This could be published soon as the data is very recent or could wait until the beginning of the school year when many teenagers are receiving vaccinations. 
I would like to create an interactive color coordinated graph of the United States. When you scroll over each state it tells how many young women have received either 1 vaccine in the series or have completed the series. 
I would like to talk to members of the CDC and other researchers who have reported on the subject. 

3. What type of sport should you play? 
Playing sports is a very common American pastime, especially for children. The type of sport you play has a lot to do with your personality. Depending on if you are introverted or extroverted, you may like to play one sport over another. Further, playing a sport that does not match with your personality will probably make you very unhappy. This could be published soon or it could be published at the beginning of the summer or school year, when a lot of kids are signing up for different sports or activities. 
This subject has been reported on before but only in the form of a quiz, which is not very visual or interactive and does not explain why you should chose one sport over another. My project would be an info graphic that would help kids and adults figure out what sport they should be playing. Ideally this info graphic would be a flow chart that would allow the viewer to answer questions and end with which sports they are most compatible with.
To get the information correct, I would want to speak to sports psychologists and possibly teachers and use other data in order to make sure the answers are accurate. 
Because it includes some science with input from sports psychologists, this could be pitched to a number of science magazines.
